# OpenTF Roadmap

This repository is intended to publicly capture the important items on the OpenTF roadmap, including milestones, like public availability of OpenTF, and what they're blocked by.

You are welcome to comment on the issues here or create your own. Once the OpenTF repository is public, these issues will be moved there.

To learn more, please see the [OpenTF Manifesto](https://opentf.org) and check out its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opentffoundation/manifesto).
